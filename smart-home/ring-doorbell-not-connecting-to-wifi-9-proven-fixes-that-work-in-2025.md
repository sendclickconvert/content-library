## The 9 Proven Fixes

### Fix 1: Check WiFi Signal at the Door
Your router works inside but signal at the front door is too weak. Stand where your Ring is installed and check signal bars.

### Fix 2: Use 2.4GHz (Not 5GHz)
**Ring only works with 2.4GHz.** If your network ends in "_5G", that's the wrong one.

### Fix 3: Double-Check Your Password
WiFi passwords are case-sensitive. Common mistakes: O vs 0, l vs 1, missing capitals.

### Fix 4: Power Cycle Everything
1. Unplug router
2. Remove Ring battery (or turn off breaker)
3. Wait 2 minutes
4. Plug router back in
5. Reconnect Ring power
6. Try setup again

### Fix 5: Update Ring App & Firmware
Outdated software causes connection bugs. Update the Ring app and check Device Health for firmware updates.

### Fix 6: Check Router Security Settings
Disable MAC filtering, AP isolation, and VPN on router temporarily.

### Fix 7: Reduce Network Congestion
Too many devices overwhelm your router. Disconnect unused devices or upgrade to mesh WiFi.

### Fix 8: Factory Reset Ring
Press and hold the orange button for 20-25 seconds. Set up as new device.

### Fix 9: Check for Outages
Visit status.ring.com to check if Ring servers are down.
