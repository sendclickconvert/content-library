## Why WiFi Drivers Break

WiFi drivers are software that lets Windows communicate with your wireless adapter. They break for several reasons:

- **Windows Update conflicts** - A recent update may have replaced or corrupted your driver
- **Driver corruption** - Files got damaged during a crash or improper shutdown
- **Hardware detection failures** - Windows lost track of your WiFi adapter
- **Power management issues** - Settings turned off your adapter to save battery

## Quick Fixes to Try First

### 1. Restart Your Computer
Seriously—this fixes more WiFi problems than you would expect. A fresh boot reloads all drivers.

### 2. Check the Physical WiFi Switch
Many laptops have a physical switch or function key (usually F2 or Fn+F2) that enables/disables WiFi. Make sure it is ON.

### 3. Run the Network Troubleshooter
1. Right-click the WiFi icon in your taskbar
2. Select "Troubleshoot problems"
3. Follow the prompts

Windows will attempt to detect and fix common issues automatically.

## Fix 1: Update or Reinstall the WiFi Driver

This is the most reliable fix for driver problems:

1. Press **Windows + X** and select **Device Manager**
2. Expand **Network adapters**
3. Right-click your WiFi adapter (usually has "Wireless" or "WiFi" in the name)
4. Select **Update driver** → **Search automatically for drivers**

If that does not work:
1. Right-click the adapter again
2. Select **Uninstall device**
3. Check "Delete the driver software for this device"
4. Restart your computer
5. Windows will reinstall a fresh driver on boot

## Fix 2: Roll Back the Driver

If WiFi stopped working after an update:

1. Open Device Manager
2. Right-click your WiFi adapter → **Properties**
3. Go to the **Driver** tab
4. Click **Roll Back Driver**

This reverts to the previous working version.

## Fix 3: Download Driver Without Internet

No internet makes downloading drivers tricky. Here is how to work around it:

**Option A: Use your phone as a hotspot**
1. Enable Mobile Hotspot on your phone
2. Connect your laptop via USB tethering
3. Download the driver from your laptop manufacturer website

**Option B: Use another computer**
1. Go to your laptop manufacturer website (Dell, HP, Lenovo, etc.)
2. Find your model and download the WiFi driver
3. Copy it to a USB drive
4. Install on your laptop

## Fix 4: Reset Network Settings

1. Go to **Settings** → **Network & Internet** → **Status**
2. Scroll down and click **Network reset**
3. Click **Reset now**
4. Restart your computer

This removes all network adapters and reinstalls them with default settings.

## Fix 5: Check Power Management

Windows sometimes disables WiFi to save power:

1. Open Device Manager
2. Right-click your WiFi adapter → **Properties**
3. Go to **Power Management** tab
4. Uncheck "Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power"
5. Click OK
