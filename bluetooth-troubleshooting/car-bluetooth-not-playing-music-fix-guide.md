# Car Bluetooth Not Playing Music - Fix Guide

Car Bluetooth Not Playing Music - Fix Guide | MrGrid.io 🚗 Car Bluetooth Not Playing Music Get Live Support Car Bluetooth Not Playing Music? Complete Fix Guide Your phone is connected to your car's Bluetooth. The dashboard shows the connection. Phone calls work fine. But when you try to play music from Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube Music, or any other app, the car speakers stay silent. The audio either plays through your phone's tiny speaker instead of the car's sound system, or there's no sound at all. You see the track playing on your phone, but your car acts like nothing is happening. Car Bluetooth audio issues are frustrating because they seem inconsistent. Calls work but music doesn't. Yesterday it worked, today it doesn't. One app plays fine while another stays silent. These problems have specific causes. Bluetooth has separate profiles for calls and media, and sometimes only one connects properly. Volume settings, audio source selection, and phone permissions all play a role. These fixes work for any car with Bluetooth — factory systems, aftermarket stereos, and Bluetooth adapters. Why Car Bluetooth Connects But Won't Play Music Understanding how car Bluetooth works helps you fix it faster. Bluetooth uses different "profiles" for different functions. HFP (Hands-Free Profile) handles phone calls. A2DP (Advanced Audio Distribution Profile) handles music streaming. Your phone can connect to your car with HFP for calls while A2DP for music fails to connect. That's why calls work but music doesn't. Several factors cause A2DP connection failures or music playback issues. Media audio not enabled is the most common cause on Android phones. The phone connects for calls but media audio is disabled, preventing music streaming. Wrong audio source on car stereo means the car is connected but set to FM radio, CD, or AUX instead of Bluetooth audio. Volume issues include phone volume being down, car volume being down, or app volume being muted independently. App permissions may prevent certain apps from playing through Bluetooth if they lack the necessary audio permissions. Corrupted pairing data between your phone and car can cause partial connections where some features work and others don't. Car system needing reset happens when the infotainment system gets stuck in a bad state. 1 Enable Media Audio (Android) On Android phones, Bluetooth connections have separate toggles for phone calls and media audio. If media audio is disabled, music won't play through the car even when connected. Check Media Audio Setting Go to Settings, then Connected Devices or Bluetooth. Find your car in the list of paired devices and tap on it or tap the gear icon next to it. Look for toggles labeled "Media audio," "Audio," or "A2DP." Make sure this is turned ON. "Phone audio" or "Calls" is separate and controls whether calls go through the car. If Media audio was off, turn it on and try playing music again. If the Toggle Won't Stay On Sometimes the media audio toggle turns itself off immediately. This usually indicates a compatibility issue. Try forgetting the car and re-pairing from scratch. 2 Select Bluetooth as Audio Source on Car Many car stereos don't automatically switch to Bluetooth when your phone connects. The car might be set to FM radio, SiriusXM, CD, USB, or AUX input. Change Audio Source Press the Source or Mode button on your car stereo or steering wheel controls. Cycle through options until you see "Bluetooth," "BT Audio," "Bluetooth Audio," or your phone's name. On touchscreen systems, look for a menu with audio sources and select the Bluetooth option. Some Cars Have Separate Phone and Music Bluetooth Some infotainment systems show Bluetooth Phone and Bluetooth Audio as separate sources. Make sure you select the Audio option, not just Phone. 3 Check All Volume Levels Multiple volume controls can mute or lower your music. Check all of them. Phone Media Volume While music is playing, press the volume buttons on your phone. Make sure the media volume bar is turned up, not just the ringer volume. On most phones, you'll see separate sliders for ring, media, and alarm volume. Car Volume Turn up your car stereo's volume using the volume knob or steering wheel controls. Even if Bluetooth is connected, you won't hear anything if car volume is at zero. App Volume Open the music app you're trying to use. Check for an in-app volume control. Some apps like Spotify have their own volume slider independent of system volume. Bluetooth Volume on Phone Some phones have separate Bluetooth volume. On Android, go to Settings, Connected Devices, your car, and look for volume settings. On iPhone, this is controlled by the main volume when connected. 4 Start Playing Music Before Connecting Some car systems don't properly initialize audio streaming when the phone connects silently. Starting music playback before or immediately after connecting can help. Try This Sequence Open your music app and start playing a song. Then turn on your car. Your phone should connect automatically, and the music stream should transfer to the car speakers. If music doesn't switch to the car, check that Bluetooth source is selected on the car stereo. 5 Forget and Re-Pair Corrupted pairing data causes partial connections where calls work but music doesn't. Forgetting the connection and pairing fresh creates new connection data. Forget from Phone On iPhone, go to Settings, Bluetooth. Tap the "i" next to your car's name. Tap Forget This Device. On Android, go to Settings, Connected Devices, find your car, tap the gear icon, and select Forget or Unpair. Clear from Car Go into your car's Bluetooth settings (usually through the infotainment menu) and delete your phone from the paired devices list. Pair Again With both sides cleared, pair fresh. Put the car in Bluetooth pairing mode (check your car's manual for how). On your phone, go to Bluetooth settings and select your car to pair. During pairing, accept all prompts for contacts, calls, AND media audio. Declining any of these can cause partial connections. 6 Check App Permissions (iPhone) On iPhone, apps need permission to access Bluetooth. If a music app doesn't have Bluetooth permission, it may not play through car speakers. Go to Settings, Privacy and Security, Bluetooth. Find your music app in the list and make sure the toggle is ON. Also check Settings, your music app, and look for any permission toggles that might be disabled. 7 Disable Other Bluetooth Connections If your phone is connected to multiple Bluetooth devices, audio might route to the wrong one. Your phone might be sending music to wireless earbuds in your bag instead of your car. Check Connected Devices On iPhone, go to Settings, Bluetooth, and see what's connected. On Android, check Settings, Connected Devices. Disconnect or turn off any other Bluetooth audio devices. Wireless earbuds, speakers, and other headphones should be disconnected when trying to play through your car. 8 Restart Your Phone A simple phone restart clears temporary Bluetooth glitches and resets audio routing. Turn your phone off completely, wait 30 seconds, then turn it back on. After it boots, let it reconnect to your car and try playing music. 9 Reset Car Infotainment System Car infotainment systems can get stuck in bad states. Resetting the system clears glitches without losing your settings. Soft Reset Turn your car completely off (engine off, not just accessory mode). Wait 2-3 minutes for the infotainment system to fully shut down. Start the car again. Hard Reset Some cars allow a hard reset by holding specific buttons on the stereo (often the power button) for 10-15 seconds. Check your car's manual for reset procedures. Factory Reset As a last resort, some infotainment systems can be factory reset through the settings menu. This clears all paired devices and settings, so you'll need to re-pair your phone and restore preferences. 10 Update Phone and Car Software Bluetooth compatibility issues are sometimes fixed through software updates on either your phone or your car. Update Your Phone On iPhone, go to Settings, General, Software Update. On Android, go to Settings, System, Software Update. Update Car Software Many modern cars receive over-the-air updates or can be updated at the dealership. Check your car manufacturer's website or owner's manual for update procedures. Some aftermarket stereos can be updated via USB or through a smartphone app from the manufacturer. Additional Troubleshooting Test with a Different Phone Try connecting a different phone to your car to determine if the issue is with your phone or the car system. If another phone works fine, focus on troubleshooting your phone. If no phones work, the car's Bluetooth system may have an issue. Test with a Different App If Spotify doesn't play through car Bluetooth, try Apple Music, YouTube Music, or even the built-in music player. If some apps work and others don't, the issue is app-specific. Check iPhone Audio Routing On iPhone, some apps have audio output options. When music is playing, swipe to Control Center, long-press the audio card, and tap the AirPlay icon. Select your car from the list if it appears. Android Auto or Apple CarPlay If standard Bluetooth audio won't work, try Android Auto (USB cable) or Apple CarPlay if your car supports them. These provide more reliable audio streaming than Bluetooth. When to Seek Professional Help If you've tried all these fixes and car Bluetooth still won't play music, there might be a hardware issue with your car's Bluetooth module or phone. Consider professional help if no phones can stream music to your car (other devices have the same problem), the car's infotainment system shows error messages, Bluetooth worked before and stopped after a car system update, or you suspect physical damage to the car stereo. Your car dealer can diagnose infotainment issues, and some problems may be covered under warranty. Still Can't Play Music Through Car Bluetooth? If your car Bluetooth won't stream music after trying everything, there might be a compatibility issue or hardware problem that needs expert diagnosis. Chat With a Tech Expert Now Frequently Asked Questions Why do phone calls work but not music? Bluetooth uses separate profiles for calls (HFP) and music (A2DP). They connect independently. If calls work but music doesn't, the A2DP profile didn't connect. On Android, check that Media Audio is enabled. Try forgetting and re-pairing the connection. Why does Bluetooth music only work sometimes? Intermittent issues often stem from interference, low phone battery, distance, or the car system entering sleep mode. Try keeping your phone charged, placing it closer to the car's Bluetooth antenna, and making sure the car stereo is set to Bluetooth source. Why does my phone connect to car Bluetooth but show no audio? The car is probably not set to Bluetooth audio source. Press the Source or Mode button on your stereo to switch to Bluetooth. Also check that volume is up on both your phone and car. Can old car stereos play Bluetooth music? Some older cars only support Bluetooth for calls, not music streaming. Check your car's manual for A2DP support. If your car doesn't support it, you can add a Bluetooth adapter that plugs into AUX or FM transmits. Why does my music app pause when I connect to car Bluetooth? Some phones pause media when Bluetooth connects as a safety feature. Simply press play again after connecting. You may also be able to disable this in your music app's settings.
