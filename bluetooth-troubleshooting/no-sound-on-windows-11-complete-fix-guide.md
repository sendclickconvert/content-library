# No Sound on Windows 11 - Complete Fix Guide

No Sound on Windows 11 - Fix Guide | MrGrid.io 🔇 No Sound on Windows 11 Get Live Support No Sound on Windows 11? Complete Fix Guide Your Windows 11 computer suddenly has no audio. Videos play silently. Music apps show playback but you hear nothing. System sounds are absent. Or you just upgraded to Windows 11 and your speakers stopped working. Audio issues in Windows 11 are frustratingly common, especially after updates. The operating system has multiple layers of audio configuration, and problems at any layer can cause complete silence. The good news is that Windows 11 audio problems are almost always software issues. Your speakers or headphones probably aren't broken. Something in Windows needs adjustment. These fixes work for built-in speakers, external speakers, headphones, and Bluetooth audio devices. Why Windows 11 Loses Audio Understanding where audio problems occur helps you fix them faster. Windows 11 processes audio through several layers: the application, the Windows audio service, the audio driver, and finally the hardware. Wrong output device selected is the most common cause. Windows might be sending audio to a device you're not using — like HDMI when you want speakers, or headphones that aren't plugged in. Volume muted or too low seems obvious but gets overlooked. Windows has system volume, app-specific volume, and hardware volume, all independent. Audio drivers corrupted after Windows Update happens frequently. Updates sometimes break existing drivers or install incompatible versions. Windows Audio service stopped prevents all audio from working. This service manages sound throughout the system. Audio enhancements causing conflicts can make audio disappear entirely rather than enhancing it. Hardware issues like loose cables, damaged ports, or failed speakers are less common but possible. 1 Check Volume and Mute Status Start with the simplest fix. Multiple volume controls exist in Windows, and any of them could be muted or turned down. System Volume Click the speaker icon in the taskbar. Make sure the volume slider isn't at zero and isn't muted. The speaker icon shows an X when muted. Use your keyboard's volume keys to raise the volume. Press the mute key to toggle mute off if it's active. Volume Mixer Right-click the speaker icon and select Open volume mixer. This shows volume levels for each application. Make sure the app you're trying to hear isn't muted or turned down individually. Some apps like browsers have their own volume for each tab. A muted YouTube tab will be silent even if the browser's volume is up. Hardware Volume External speakers and monitors often have their own volume controls. Check for physical volume knobs or buttons on your speakers. Make sure they're turned up and not muted. 2 Select the Correct Output Device Windows might be sending audio to the wrong destination. If you have multiple audio devices — speakers, headphones, monitors, Bluetooth — the wrong one might be selected. Quick Output Selection Click the speaker icon in the taskbar, then click the arrow next to the volume slider. This shows all available output devices. Select the one you want to use — your speakers, headphones, or Bluetooth device. Through Settings Go to Settings, then System, then Sound. Under Output, click the dropdown menu to see all available devices. Select your speakers or headphones. Look for your device name. Built-in speakers might be called "Speakers" or "Realtek Audio." External speakers might show the manufacturer name. Bluetooth devices show their product name. Set as Default In the Sound settings, click on your desired output device, then click "Set as default." This ensures Windows uses this device by default rather than randomly switching. 3 Run the Audio Troubleshooter Windows 11 includes a built-in troubleshooter that can identify and fix common audio problems automatically. Go to Settings, then System, then Troubleshoot. Click Other troubleshooters. Find "Playing Audio" and click Run. The troubleshooter will scan your system, identify issues, and attempt fixes. Follow any prompts it provides. After it completes, test your audio. 4 Restart Windows Audio Service The Windows Audio service manages all audio on your computer. If it crashes or gets stuck, no audio will play until it's restarted. Restart the Service Press Windows key, type "services" and open the Services app. Scroll down to find "Windows Audio" in the list. Check the Status column. It should say "Running." If it says anything else or is blank, the service isn't running properly. Right-click Windows Audio and select Restart. If Restart is grayed out, select Start instead. Check Dependencies Windows Audio depends on other services. While in Services, also find and restart "Windows Audio Endpoint Builder" and "Remote Procedure Call (RPC)." Set to Automatic Right-click Windows Audio and select Properties. Make sure Startup type is set to "Automatic." This ensures the service starts with Windows. Click OK. 5 Update Audio Drivers Outdated or corrupted audio drivers are a leading cause of Windows 11 sound problems, especially after system updates. Update Through Device Manager Press Windows key, type "device manager" and open it. Expand "Sound, video and game controllers." Right-click your audio device — it might be called "Realtek Audio," "High Definition Audio Device," or your sound card's name. Select Update driver, then "Search automatically for drivers." If Windows finds an update, install it and restart your computer. Get Drivers from Manufacturer Generic Windows drivers don't always work well. Visit your computer manufacturer's website (Dell, HP, Lenovo, ASUS, etc.) and download the specific audio driver for your model. If you have a dedicated sound card, visit that manufacturer's website instead. Reinstall Audio Drivers If updating doesn't help, try reinstalling. In Device Manager, right-click your audio device and select Uninstall device. Check "Delete the driver software for this device" if that option appears. Restart your computer. Windows will automatically reinstall audio drivers. If the generic drivers don't work, install the manufacturer's drivers. 6 Disable Audio Enhancements Audio enhancements are supposed to improve sound quality, but they sometimes cause audio to stop working entirely. Disable Enhancements Go to Settings, System, Sound. Click on your output device to open its properties. Scroll down to find "Audio enhancements" or "Enhance audio." Turn this off. You can also access this through the classic Sound control panel. Right-click the speaker icon, select Sound settings, then scroll down and click "More sound settings." In the Sound window, go to the Playback tab. Right-click your speakers and select Properties. Go to the Enhancements tab and check "Disable all enhancements." Click OK. 7 Check Physical Connections If you're using external speakers or headphones, physical connection issues can cause silence. Wired Speakers and Headphones Make sure cables are fully plugged in. Audio jacks can work loose over time. Unplug and firmly replug all audio cables. Try a different audio port if your computer has multiple jacks. The front panel jacks and rear jacks are separate, and one might work while the other doesn't. Try the same speakers or headphones on another device to verify they work. If they don't work anywhere, the problem is with the audio device, not your computer. USB Audio Devices Try a different USB port. USB ports can fail or have power issues. USB 3.0 ports (usually blue) sometimes have compatibility issues with audio devices — try a USB 2.0 port if available. Bluetooth Audio For Bluetooth speakers or headphones, make sure they're connected and selected as the audio output. See our guide on Bluetooth Paired But No Sound for detailed Bluetooth troubleshooting. 8 Check Audio Format Sometimes Windows sets an audio format that your speakers don't support, causing silence. Right-click the speaker icon in the taskbar and select Sound settings. Scroll down and click "More sound settings." In the Playback tab, right-click your speakers and select Properties. Go to the Advanced tab. Under Default Format, try selecting a different sample rate and bit depth. Common compatible formats include "16 bit, 44100 Hz (CD Quality)" and "24 bit, 48000 Hz." Click Test after each change to hear if audio works. Once you find a working format, click Apply and OK. 9 Check for Windows Updates Microsoft releases fixes for known audio issues through Windows Update. Installing pending updates might resolve your problem. Go to Settings, Windows Update. Click "Check for updates." Install any available updates, including optional ones that might include driver updates. Restart your computer after updates complete and test audio. 10 Roll Back Audio Driver If your audio stopped working after a recent driver update, rolling back to the previous driver might fix it. Open Device Manager. Expand "Sound, video and game controllers." Right-click your audio device and select Properties. Go to the Driver tab. Click "Roll Back Driver" if it's available. This option is only available if a previous driver version exists. Follow the prompts and restart your computer. Advanced Troubleshooting System File Checker Corrupted system files can cause audio problems. Open Command Prompt as Administrator and run: sfc /scannow Wait for the scan to complete. If it finds and repairs issues, restart and test audio. DISM Command If SFC doesn't help, run DISM to repair Windows system image. Open Command Prompt as Administrator and run: DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth This can take 15-30 minutes. Restart after it completes. Reset Audio Settings You can reset all audio settings to defaults. Go to Settings, System, Sound. Scroll to the bottom and click "Volume mixer." Click "Reset" to restore default volumes for all apps. Check BIOS Audio Setting On rare occasions, audio can be disabled in BIOS. Restart your computer and enter BIOS (usually by pressing F2, F12, Delete, or Esc during startup). Look for audio settings in the peripherals or integrated devices section. Make sure onboard audio is Enabled. When to Seek Professional Help If none of these fixes restore your audio, there might be a hardware problem with your sound card or speakers. Consider professional help if you've tried all software fixes without success, Device Manager shows errors or warnings next to audio devices, audio ports appear physically damaged, or your computer makes no sounds at all, including startup sounds. Still No Sound on Windows 11? If you've tried everything and audio still doesn't work, there might be hardware issues or complex driver conflicts that need expert diagnosis. Chat With a Tech Expert Now Frequently Asked Questions Why did my sound stop working after a Windows update? Windows updates sometimes break audio drivers or change settings. Try updating your audio drivers from the manufacturer's website, or roll back to a previous driver version if available. Why do I have sound in some apps but not others? Each app can have its own volume setting. Right-click the speaker icon, select Volume mixer, and check the volume for the app that isn't playing sound. Also check the app's internal audio settings. Why does sound work in headphones but not speakers? Windows might be set to output to headphones as default. Select your speakers as the output device in Sound settings. Also check that the speakers are powered on and the cable is properly connected. Can I have audio issues with a bad HDMI cable? Yes. If you're sending audio through HDMI to a monitor or TV, a damaged or low-quality HDMI cable can cause audio problems. Try a different cable, or switch to a separate audio output. Why does Windows show the wrong audio device? Windows remembers devices you've connected before. Phantom devices can appear from previous connections. Go to Sound settings and set your actual device as default. You can also disable unused devices.
