# Out Of Memory Error Fix? Here's How to Fix It Fast

# Out of Memory Error Fix: Complete Guide to Solving Memory Problems (2024)

You're in the middle of something important—maybe editing photos, gaming, or running a critical work application—and suddenly everything freezes. A message pops up: "Out of Memory" or "Your system has run out of memory." Your heart sinks.

We've all been there. That moment when your device grinds to a halt, unsaved work hangs in the balance, and frustration sets in. The good news? Out of memory errors are almost always fixable, and you don't need to be a tech wizard to solve them.

In this comprehensive guide, we'll walk you through everything you need to know about fixing out of memory errors on any device. Whether you're using Windows, Mac, Android, or iOS, we've got practical solutions that actually work.

## What Does "Out of Memory" Actually Mean?

Before we dive into fixes, let's quickly understand what's happening. Your device has two types of memory:

**RAM (Random Access Memory)** is your device's short-term memory. It's where your computer stores information it needs RIGHT NOW—like the apps you're currently using, browser tabs, and active documents.

**Storage (Hard Drive or SSD)** is your long-term memory. This is where files, photos, videos, and installed programs live permanently.

An "out of memory" error usually means your RAM is full. Think of RAM like a desk where you're working—once the desk is covered with papers, there's no room to work on anything new.

## Quick Diagnosis Checklist: Start Here First

Before diving into complex solutions, run through this quick checklist. These simple checks solve memory errors about 40% of the time:

- **Is anything downloading or installing?** Large downloads or updates consume massive amounts of memory
- **How many browser tabs do you have open?** Each tab uses RAM (Chrome is notorious for this)
- **Did you recently update an app or your operating system?** Sometimes updates cause memory leaks
- **Is your device hot to the touch?** Overheating can cause memory management issues
- **When did you last restart your device?** A simple restart clears temporary memory
- **Are you running multiple heavy programs simultaneously?** Video editors, games, and virtual machines are memory hogs

Make a mental note of your answers. They'll guide which solutions to try first.

## The Fix Ladder: Solutions From Easiest to Advanced

Let's start with the simplest fixes and work our way up. Try these in order—don't skip ahead unless you're confident about what's causing the problem.

### Solution 1: The Restart (Solves 30% of Memory Errors)

This sounds almost insulting in its simplicity, but restarting genuinely fixes most memory issues. Here's why: when programs close, they should release the RAM they were using. But sometimes they don't release it properly—this is called a "memory leak."

Restarting clears all RAM and gives you a fresh start.

**How to restart properly:**

**Windows:**
- Click Start → Power icon → Restart (NOT shut down)
- Or press Ctrl + Alt + Delete → Power icon → Restart

**Mac:**
- Click Apple menu → Restart
- Don't select "Reopen windows when logging back in"

**Android:**
- Hold the power button → Tap Restart
- If Restart isn't an option, select Power Off, wait 30 seconds, then power back on

**iOS:**
- iPhone with Face ID: Press Volume Up, Volume Down, then hold Side button until you see the Apple logo
- iPhone with Home button: Hold Home + Power button until you see the Apple logo

After restarting, try the task that triggered the error. If it works, great! If not, continue to the next solution.

### Solution 2: Close Memory-Hungry Applications

Some applications are greedy with memory. Browsers with dozens of tabs, video editing software, games, and virtual machines can consume gigabytes of RAM.

**Find out what's using your memory:**

**Windows:**
- Press **Ctrl + Shift + Esc** to open Task Manager
- Click the "Memory" column header to sort by memory usage
- Look for programs using over 500 MB

**Mac:**
- Press **Command + Space**, type "Activity Monitor"
- Click the "Memory" tab
- Sort by "Memory" to see the biggest users

**Android:**
- Go to Settings → Battery → Battery Usage (shows resource-heavy apps)
- Or Settings → Apps → Running Services

**iOS:**
- iOS doesn't show memory usage directly, but recently used apps appear in the app switcher
- Double-click Home button (or swipe up on newer models) to see all open apps

**Close applications you're not actively using:**

- **Don't just minimize them**—actually close them completely
- In Windows/Mac: Right-click the program in the taskbar and select "Close" or "Quit"
- On mobile: Swipe away apps in the app switcher
- **Browser users**: Close unused tabs or use a tab suspender extension

Pro tip: Browsers are usually the worst offenders. A single Chrome tab can use 200-500 MB of RAM. If you regularly have 20+ tabs open, that's 4-10 GB gone.

### Solution 3: Increase Virtual Memory (Windows/Mac)

Virtual memory is a clever trick: your device uses a portion of your hard drive or SSD as "pretend RAM" when the real RAM fills up. It's slower than actual RAM, but it prevents crashes.

**Windows - Increase Page File Size:**

- Right-click "This PC" or "My Computer" → Properties
- Click "Advanced system settings" on the left
- Under "Performance," click **Settings**
- Go to the "Advanced" tab → Click **Change** under Virtual Memory
- Uncheck "Automatically manage paging file size"
- Select your main drive (usually C:)
- Choose **Custom size**
- Set Initial size to: 1.5 × your RAM amount (in MB)
- Set Maximum size to: 3 × your RAM amount (in MB)
  - Example: If you have 8 GB RAM (8192 MB), set Initial to 12288 MB and Maximum to 24576 MB
- Click **Set**, then **OK**
- **Restart your computer** for changes to take effect

**Mac - This is handled automatically, but you can check:**

- Mac manages virtual memory on its own
- Make sure you have at least 15-20% of your storage drive free
- Go to Apple menu → About This Mac → Storage
- If your drive is over 85% full, delete files or move them to external storage

### Solution 4: Disable Startup Programs

Many programs automatically launch when you turn on your device. They sit in the background, consuming memory even when you're not using them.

**Windows:**

- Press **Ctrl + Shift + Esc** → Go to the "Startup" tab
- Look at the "Startup impact" column
- Right-click programs you don't need at startup → Select **Disable**
- Safe to disable: Chat apps, cloud storage sync (Dropbox, OneDrive), printer utilities, game launchers
- Do NOT disable: Antivirus, graphics drivers, audio drivers

**Mac:**

- Apple menu → System Preferences → Users & Groups
- Click your username → Select "Login Items" tab
- Select unnecessary items → Click the **minus (-)** button below
- Common culprits: Spotify, Steam, messaging apps

**Android:**

- Most Android apps don't truly "start up," but you can limit background activity
- Settings → Apps → Select the app → Battery → Background restriction

**iOS:**

- iOS manages this automatically
- You can prevent apps from refreshing in the background: Settings → General → Background App Refresh → Turn off for specific apps

### Solution 5: Update or Reinstall Problematic Applications

If a specific program always triggers the memory error, that program might have a bug or memory leak. This is especially common after operating system updates that break compatibility. If you're experiencing issues after an update, our guide on [apps that won't load after updates](/guides/app-wont-load-after-update) can help troubleshoot similar problems.

**Try this:**

- **Check for updates**: Open the application → Look for "Check for Updates" in the Help or Settings menu
- **Reinstall the program**: Uninstall completely, restart, then download the latest version from the official website
- **Check compatibility**: If you recently updated your operating system, verify the app supports your OS version

**Real-world example:** Many users experienced memory errors with Adobe Photoshop after upgrading to Windows 11. Adobe released a patch update that fixed the issue. Always check the software developer's support forums.

### Solution 6: Add More RAM (Hardware Upgrade)

If you've tried everything and still hit memory limits during normal use, you might genuinely need more RAM. This is a hardware upgrade, but it's often cheaper and easier than you think.

**How much RAM do you need?**

- **Basic use** (web browsing, email, documents): 8 GB minimum
- **Moderate use** (photo editing, multitasking): 16 GB recommended
- **Heavy use** (video editing, gaming, 3D rendering): 32 GB or more

**Can you upgrade?**

- **Desktop PCs**: Almost always upgradeable—RAM is usually accessible
- **Laptops**: Some models allow upgrades, others have soldered RAM
- **Macs**: Most modern Macs (2016+) have non-upgradeable RAM
- **Tablets/Phones**: Cannot be upgraded

**How to upgrade (Desktop/Laptop):**

- Identify your device model and current RAM
- Check your manual or use a tool like Crucial System Scanner
- Purchase compatible RAM modules
- Watch a YouTube tutorial specific to your device model
- Installation usually takes 10-15 minutes

**Not comfortable opening your device?** Consider taking it to a local computer repair shop. RAM installation typically costs $50-100 including labor.

### Solution 7: Clean Up Your Storage Drive

When your hard drive or SSD is too full, virtual memory can't work properly. You need at least 10-15% free space.

**Quick storage cleanup:**

**Windows:**

- Open Settings → System → **Storage**
- Click "Free up space now" or "Temporary files"
- Select: Downloads, Temporary files, Recycle Bin, Previous Windows installations
- Click **Remove files**

**Mac:**

- Apple menu → About This Mac → **Storage** → **Manage**
- Use "Recommendations": Store in iCloud, Optimize Storage, Empty Trash Automatically
- Check Downloads folder and delete old files

**Android:**

- Settings → Storage → **Free up space**
- Delete cached data, old downloads, and unused apps

**iOS:**

- Settings → General → iPhone Storage
- Review "Recommendations" at the top
- Delete large apps you don't use
- Offload unused apps (keeps data but removes the app)

**What to delete:**

- Old downloads you've forgotten about
- Duplicate photos and videos
- Temporary files and cache
- Programs you haven't used in 6+ months
- Browser cache (can be gigabytes)

### Solution 8: Scan for Malware

Malicious software can cause memory leaks and consume resources in the background. Some crypto-mining malware specifically targets system memory.

**Run a scan:**

**Windows:**

- Open Windows Security (built into Windows 10/11)
- Click "Virus & threat protection"
- Click "Quick scan" or "Scan options" → "Full scan"
- Let it run completely (can take 30-60 minutes)

**Mac:**

- Download Malwarebytes for Mac (free version)
- Run a full scan
- Macs can get malware despite the myth they can't

**Android:**

- Download Google Play Protect (built-in) or Malwarebytes
- Run a full scan

**iOS:**

- iOS malware is extremely rare due to sandboxing
- If you suspect issues, delete recently installed apps
- Reset settings: Settings → General → Transfer or Reset → Reset → Reset All Settings

## Device-Specific Deep Dives

Different operating systems have unique memory quirks. Here's what to know for your specific device.

- These apps accumulate gigabytes of cache

**Disable Animations:**

This isn't a direct memory fix, but it makes limited memory feel faster.

- Settings → About Phone → Tap "Build Number" 7 times (enables Developer Options)
- Settings → System → Developer Options
- Find "Window animation scale," "Transition animation scale," "Animator duration scale"
- Set all to "Animation off" or "0.5x"

**Factory Reset (Last Resort):**

If nothing works and your Android device is consistently slow:

- **Back up everything first** (photos, contacts, etc.)
- Settings → System → Reset Options → **Erase all data (factory reset)**
- This returns your device to like-new condition

### iOS-Specific Solutions

**Offload Unused Apps:**

iOS can automatically remove apps you don't use while keeping their data.

- Settings → General → iPhone Storage
- Enable "**Offload Unused Apps**" at the top
- Or manually offload individual apps

**Reduce Motion and Transparency:**

- Settings → Accessibility → Motion → Enable "**Reduce Motion**"
- Settings → Accessibility → Display & Text Size → Enable "**Reduce Transparency**"

These reduce memory used for visual effects.

**Clear Safari Cache:**

- Settings → Safari → **Clear History and Website Data**
- This can free up several gigabytes

**Check for iOS Updates:**

- Settings → General → Software Update
- Apple often releases updates that fix memory management bugs

**Update Apps:**

- Open App Store → Tap your profile icon → Scroll to see pending updates
- Update all apps, especially ones that crash or freeze

## Prevention Tips: Stop Memory Errors Before They Start

Once you've solved your immediate problem, follow these practices to prevent future memory errors:

### Daily Habits

**Close what you're not using.** It sounds obvious, but this is the #1 prevention method. Don't leave 50 browser tabs open "because you might need them later." Bookmark them instead.

**Restart weekly.** Set a reminder to restart your device once a week. This clears memory leaks before they become problems.

**Monitor your multitasking.** If you notice your device slowing down, check what's running. Don't wait for the error message.

### Monthly Maintenance

**Clear browser cache.** Set a monthly reminder to clear your browser's cache and cookies. Every browser has this option in Settings → Privacy.

**Update everything.** Enable automatic updates for your operating system and applications. Updates often include memory management improvements.

**Review installed programs.** Once a month, uninstall programs you no longer use. Every installed program potentially runs background processes.

### Long-Term Practices

**Choose lightweight alternatives.** For example:
- Use Firefox instead of Chrome (uses less RAM)
- Use Photos app instead of Photoshop for simple edits
- Use web versions of apps instead of installing desktop versions

**Manage browser extensions.** Each browser extension uses memory. Disable ones you don't use daily.

**Keep 20% storage free.** Make it a rule to never let your storage drive get above 80% full. This ensures virtual memory works smoothly.

**Invest in RAM when buying.** If you're purchasing a new device, buy more RAM than you think you need. You can't upgrade later on most modern devices. 16 GB is the sweet spot for most users.

## When to Call for Professional Help

Sometimes, out of memory errors indicate deeper problems. Here's when to escalate:

### Hardware Failure Signs

**Contact support or a repair shop if:**

- Memory errors persist after trying ALL solutions above
- You get errors even with nothing running
- Windows Memory Diagnostic finds errors
- Your device crashes frequently with Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) or kernel panics
- Physical damage to your device (drops, liquid spills)

### It's Worth Professional Help When:

- **The device is mission-critical** and you can't risk making things worse
- **You're not comfortable** opening your computer to install RAM
- **Data recovery is needed** before attempting fixes
- **Time is money** and DIY troubleshooting would take hours

### Warranty Considerations

**Before attempting hardware fixes:**

- Check if your device is still under warranty
- Opening your device often voids warranties
- Contact manufacturer support first if covered

**Manufacturer support contacts:**
- Apple: 1-800-275-2273 or apple.com/support
- Microsoft: microsoft.com/support
- Dell: dell.com/support
- HP: hp.com/support
- Samsung: samsung.com/us/support

## Real-World Success Stories

Let's look at how real users solved their memory errors:

### Case Study 1: The Browser Tab Hoarder

**Problem:** Sarah's Windows laptop showed "out of memory" errors every afternoon. She had 8 GB RAM, which should be enough for her work.

**Discovery:** She typically had 60+ Chrome tabs open across three windows. Chrome was using 6.5 GB of her 8 GB RAM.

**Solution:** Installed the "OneTab" extension to suspend unused tabs. Her RAM usage dropped to 2.5 GB, and errors stopped.

**Lesson:** Browser tabs are silent memory killers. Each tab is essentially a mini-program.

### Case Study 2: The Memory Leak

**Problem:** James's iMac with 16 GB RAM started showing memory pressure warnings after a macOS update. Activity Monitor showed 14 GB in use even after closing apps.

**Solution:** A specific app (an older version of Slack) had a memory leak. Updating Slack to the latest version and restarting fixed it.

**Lesson:** Always keep apps updated, especially after OS updates. Developer forums often discuss known memory leak issues.

### Case Study 3: The Full Drive

**Problem:** Maria's Android phone constantly showed "insufficient memory" despite having a 64 GB SD card with 40 GB free.

**Discovery:** Her internal storage (16 GB) was 98% full. Android can't use SD card space as RAM or for virtual memory.

**Solution:** Moved photos and videos to the SD card, deleted app cache, freed 6 GB of internal storage. Errors stopped completely.

**Lesson:** On Android, internal storage fullness causes memory errors, not SD card fullness.

## Advanced Troubleshooting for Power Users

If you're technically inclined, these advanced methods can help diagnose stubborn issues.

### Memory Profiling Tools

**Windows:**
- RAMMap (from Microsoft Sysinternals): Shows exactly what's using memory
- Process Explorer: Advanced task manager with detailed memory info

**Mac:**
- Instruments (part of Xcode): Professional memory profiling
- Memory Clean 3: Real-time memory monitoring and cleaning

**Linux:**
- htop: Real-time process monitoring
- vmstat: Virtual memory statistics

### Check for Memory-Specific Event Logs

**Windows Event Viewer:**
- Press Windows Key + R → type "**eventvwr**"
- Navigate to Windows Logs → System
- Filter for "Event ID 2004" (memory resource exhaustion)
- Look for patterns: Does it happen with specific programs?

**Mac Console:**
- Applications → Utilities → Console
- Search for "memory" in the search bar
- Look for "kernel" entries mentioning memory pressure

### Registry Tweaks (Windows - Advanced Users Only)

**Warning:** Incorrect registry changes can break Windows. Back up your registry first.

**Reduce memory usage for services:**
- Press Windows Key + R → type "**regedit**"
- Navigate to: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control
- Right-click → New → DWORD (32-bit) Value
- Name it "**SvcHostSplitThresholdInKB**"
- Set value to "**4194304**" (decimal) for systems with 4+ GB RAM
- Restart

This forces Windows to split services into separate processes, making memory leaks less impactful.

## Understanding Different Memory Error Messages

Different error messages point to different problems. Here's a decoder:

**"Your system is low on memory"** (Windows)
- RAM is nearly full
- Windows is using virtual memory (page file)
- Solution: Close programs or add RAM

**"Your system has run out of application memory"** (Mac)
- Multiple apps are using too much RAM simultaneously
- Solution: Close apps, restart, or add RAM

**"Insufficient memory to continue the execution of the program"**
- Specific program needs more memory than available
- Solution: Close other programs, increase virtual memory, or run the program on a device with more RAM

**"Not enough storage is available to process this command"**
- Often confused with memory, but this is actually about system resources
- Solution: Restart to clear resource handles

**"Storage almost full"** (Android/iOS)
- This is about storage, not RAM
- But full storage causes memory errors due to virtual memory
- Solution: Delete files, apps, photos

**"App has stopped responding due to insufficient memory"**
- The specific app has a memory leak or is too demanding
- Solution: Update or reinstall the app
