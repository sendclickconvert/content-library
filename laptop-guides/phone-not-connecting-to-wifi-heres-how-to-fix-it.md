# Phone Not Connecting to WiFi: Here's How to Fix It

# Phone Not Connecting to WiFi: Here's How to Fix It (2025)

Your phone used to connect to WiFi instantly. Now it shows the network but won't actually connect—or it connects then immediately drops. Other devices work fine on the same network. Your phone is being mysteriously selective.

This is incredibly frustrating because without WiFi, your phone is burning through data, videos won't stream, and your apps barely work.

The good news? This is almost always fixable without any technical skills.

## Why Your Phone Won't Connect

Your phone stores cached network information, IP configurations, and authentication details that can become corrupted. It also has WiFi drivers and radio settings that can malfunction. Unlike your laptop, your phone's simpler interface hides these technical details—but they're still causing the problem.

## Quick Fixes (Start Here)

### 1. Forget the Network
Go to WiFi Settings → Long-press the network name → Select "Forget"
Now reconnect and re-enter the password.

### 2. Toggle WiFi Off/On
Turn off WiFi completely, wait 10 seconds, turn it back on.

### 3. Restart Your Phone
Hold power button, slide to shut down, wait 30 seconds, power back on.

### 4. Restart Your Router
Unplug for 30 seconds, plug back in, wait 2-3 minutes.

## Advanced Fixes

### Reset Network Settings
This clears all cached network data.

**iPhone:** Settings → General → Transfer or Reset → Reset → Reset Network Settings
**Android:** Settings → System → Reset → Reset WiFi, Mobile, Bluetooth

### Check IP Configuration
Your phone might have a conflicting IP address.
