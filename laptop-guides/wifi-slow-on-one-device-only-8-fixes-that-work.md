# WiFi Slow on One Device Only? 8 Fixes That Work

# WiFi Slow on One Device Only? 8 Fixes That Work (2024)

Your WiFi works great on every device except one. Your phone streams perfectly, your smart TV has no issues, but one laptop or tablet crawls along like it's on dial-up. What's going on?

When WiFi is slow on only one device, the problem is almost always with that specific device—not your router or internet service. This makes it fixable.

This guide covers every proven solution for device-specific slow WiFi.

*This article is part of our complete [WiFi Troubleshooting Guide](/guides/how-to-fix-problems-with-wifi-connection).*

## Why One Device Has Slow WiFi

Common causes include:

- **Outdated network drivers** with performance bugs
- **Background apps** consuming bandwidth
- **Connected to 2.4GHz** instead of faster 5GHz
- **Old WiFi hardware** that doesn't support modern speeds
- **VPN or proxy** throttling your connection
- **Malware** using your bandwidth

## Fix 1: Switch to 5GHz Band

If your device is connected to the 2.4GHz band while others use 5GHz, it will be slower.

1. Check your available networks—look for one ending in "5G" or "5GHz"
2. Connect to the 5GHz network instead
3. Run a speed test to compare

5GHz is faster but has shorter range. If you don't see a 5GHz option, check your router settings to enable band separation.

## Fix 2: Update Network Drivers (Windows)

Outdated drivers are the #1 cause of slow WiFi on computers:

1. Press Windows + X → Device Manager
2. Expand "Network adapters"
3. Right-click your wireless adapter → Update driver
4. Select "Search automatically"
5. Restart and test speed

For the best drivers, visit your laptop manufacturer's website and download directly.

## Fix 3: Close Background Apps and Downloads

Other apps may be consuming your bandwidth:

**Windows:**
1. Press Ctrl + Shift + Esc to open Task Manager
2. Click the "Network" column to sort by network usage
3. Close apps using significant bandwidth

**Mac:**
1. Open Activity Monitor
2. Click the "Network" tab
3. Sort by "Sent Bytes" or "Rcvd Bytes"
4. Quit bandwidth-heavy apps

Check for:
- Cloud sync services (OneDrive, Dropbox, Google Drive)
- Software updates downloading
- Streaming apps running in background
- Torrent clients

## Fix 4: Disable VPN and Proxy

VPNs route your traffic through distant servers, slowing connection:

1. Disconnect any active VPN
2. Disable proxy settings:
   - Windows: Settings → Network & Internet → Proxy → turn off
   - Mac: System Preferences → Network → Advanced → Proxies → uncheck all
3. Test your speed

## Fix 5: Forget Network and Reconnect

Corrupted network profiles cause performance issues:

1. Forget the WiFi network on your device
2. Restart the device
3. Reconnect with password
4. Test speed

## Fix 6: Run Malware Scan

Malware can hijack your bandwidth:

1. Run a full system scan with your antivirus
2. Consider scanning with Malwarebytes (free) for a second opinion
3. Remove any threats found
4. Test speed after cleanup

## Fix 7: Check Device WiFi Hardware

Older devices have slower WiFi hardware:

- **WiFi 4 (802.11n)** - Max ~150 Mbps
- **WiFi 5 (802.11ac)** - Max ~1.3 Gbps
- **WiFi 6 (802.11ax)** - Max ~9.6 Gbps

To check your device's WiFi capability:

**Windows:**
1. Press Windows + R → type `cmd` → Enter
2. Type: `netsh wlan show drivers`
3. Look for "Radio types supported"

If your device only supports 802.11n, it will always be slower than modern devices.

## Fix 8: Reset Network Settings

As a last resort, reset all network configuration:

**Windows:**
1. Settings → Network & Internet → Status
2. Network reset → Reset now

**Mac:**
1. System Preferences → Network
2. Select WiFi → minus (-) → plus (+) to re-add

**iPhone:**
1. Settings → General → Reset → Reset Network Settings

**Android:**
1. Settings → System → Reset → Reset WiFi, mobile & Bluetooth
