# WiFi Keeps Disconnecting? 10 Fixes to Stop Random Drops

# WiFi Keeps Disconnecting? 10 Fixes to Stop Random Drops (2024)

Few things are more frustrating than WiFi that randomly disconnects. You're in the middle of a video call, streaming a movie, or downloading an important file—and suddenly the connection drops. Then it reconnects. Then it drops again.

This constant disconnecting can be caused by interference, router issues, power settings, or outdated drivers. The good news is that most causes have straightforward fixes.

This guide covers every proven solution to stop your WiFi from randomly dropping.

*This article is part of our complete [WiFi Troubleshooting Guide](/guides/how-to-fix-problems-with-wifi-connection).*

## Why WiFi Randomly Disconnects

Common causes include:

- **Signal interference** from other devices or networks
- **Power management** putting your WiFi adapter to sleep
- **Outdated drivers** with bugs or compatibility issues
- **Router overheating** or firmware problems
- **Too many connected devices** overwhelming the router
- **Distance from router** causing weak signal

## Fix 1: Disable Power Management for WiFi Adapter

Windows often puts your WiFi adapter to sleep to save power, causing disconnections.

**Windows 10/11:**
1. Press Windows + X → Device Manager
2. Expand "Network adapters"
3. Right-click your wireless adapter → Properties
4. Click the "Power Management" tab
5. Uncheck "Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power"
6. Click OK

Also check your power plan:
1. Control Panel → Power Options
2. Click "Change plan settings" next to your active plan
3. Click "Change advanced power settings"
4. Expand "Wireless Adapter Settings" → "Power Saving Mode"
5. Set both Battery and Plugged in to "Maximum Performance"

## Fix 2: Update Your WiFi Driver

Outdated drivers are a leading cause of random disconnections:

1. Press Windows + X → Device Manager
2. Expand "Network adapters"
3. Right-click your wireless adapter → Update driver
4. Select "Search automatically for drivers"
5. Restart your computer

If that doesn't find updates, visit your laptop manufacturer's website (Dell, HP, Lenovo, etc.) and download the latest WiFi driver directly.

## Fix 3: Change WiFi Channel

If you live in an apartment or dense neighborhood, your neighbors' WiFi networks may be interfering with yours.

1. Log into your router (usually 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.0.1)
2. Find Wireless Settings
3. Change the channel:
   - For 2.4GHz: Try channels 1, 6, or 11 (these don't overlap)
   - For 5GHz: Try any channel that seems less crowded
4. Save and test

Use a free app like WiFi Analyzer (Android) or NetSpot (Mac/Windows) to see which channels are least congested.

## Fix 4: Restart Your Router Properly

A proper restart clears the router's memory and can fix persistent issues:

1. Unplug router from power
2. Unplug modem if separate
3. Wait 30 seconds
4. Plug modem in first, wait 2 minutes
5. Plug router in, wait 2 minutes
6. Test your connection

## Fix 5: Move Closer to Router or Reposition It

Weak signal causes disconnections. Improve signal strength by:

- Moving your router to a central location
- Elevating it (shelf height, not floor)
- Keeping it away from metal objects, microwaves, and cordless phones
- Removing obstacles between router and devices
- Using 5GHz band if you're close to the router

## Fix 6: Forget and Reconnect to Network

Corrupted network profiles cause random drops:

**Windows:** WiFi icon → right-click network → Forget → reconnect

**Mac:** System Preferences → Network → WiFi → Advanced → select network → minus (-) → reconnect

**iPhone:** Settings → WiFi → (i) next to network → Forget This Network → reconnect

**Android:** Settings → WiFi → long-press network → Forget → reconnect

## Fix 7: Disable WiFi Sense (Windows 10)

WiFi Sense can cause connection issues:

1. Settings → Network & Internet → WiFi
2. Click "Manage WiFi settings"
3. Turn off all WiFi Sense options

## Fix 8: Reset Network Settings

If disconnections persist, reset your network configuration:

**Windows:**
1. Settings → Network & Internet → Status
2. Scroll down → Network reset
3. Click "Reset now"

**Mac:**
1. System Preferences → Network
2. Select WiFi → minus (-) to remove
3. Plus (+) to add back → Apply

## Fix 9: Update Router Firmware

Outdated router firmware contains bugs that cause disconnections:

1. Log into your router's admin panel
2. Look for "Firmware Update" or "Router Update"
3. If an update is available, install it
4. Don't unplug the router during the update

## Fix 10: Check for Overloaded Router

Too many devices overwhelm routers:

1. Log into your router
2. Check connected devices (often under "DHCP" or "Connected Devices")
3. Disconnect devices you're not using
4. Consider upgrading if you have 20+ devices

## When to Replace Your Router

Consider a new router if:
- It's more than 5 years old
- Doesn't support WiFi 5 (802.11ac) or WiFi 6
- Constantly needs rebooting
- Can't handle your number of devices

**Recommended upgrades:**
- [WiFi 6 Routers](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=wifi+6+router&tag=petart01-20) - Better device handling
- [Mesh WiFi Systems](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=mesh+wifi+system&tag=petart01-20) - Whole-home coverage
- [Long-Range Routers](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=long+range+wifi+router&tag=petart01-20) - Better signal strength
