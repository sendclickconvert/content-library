        <h2>Why Does This Happen?</h2>
        
        <p>Before we dive into the fixes, it helps to understand why your Bluetooth device can show as connected while producing no audio. This knowledge will help you identify the right solution faster and prevent the issue from happening again in the future.</p>
        
        <p>Bluetooth connections involve two separate processes that many people confuse. The first is pairing, which establishes a trust relationship between your devices so they can communicate securely. The second is the audio connection itself, which routes sound from your source device to your Bluetooth speaker or headphones. Your device can complete the pairing process successfully while failing to establish the audio connection, which is exactly what happens when you see "Connected" but hear nothing.</p>
        
        <p>The audio routing on modern devices has become increasingly complex. Your phone or computer might be sending audio to its internal speakers, to a different Bluetooth device that connected automatically, or to a wired output you forgot was plugged in. Meanwhile, your Bluetooth device sits there connected but receiving no audio stream because nothing is being sent to it.</p>
        
        <p>Driver and firmware issues also play a significant role, especially on Windows computers. Bluetooth audio relies on specific drivers that translate audio signals into the format your wireless device understands. When these drivers become outdated, corrupted, or conflict with recent system updates, the audio pathway breaks down even though the basic Bluetooth connection remains intact.</p>
        
        <h2>Fix 1: Check Your Audio Output Settings</h2>
        
        <div class="fix-step">
            <h4>The Most Common Cause</h4>
            <p>In the vast majority of cases, your Bluetooth device is not selected as the active audio output. Your system is sending sound somewhere else while your Bluetooth device waits silently for audio that never arrives.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="device-tabs">
            <span class="device-tab">Windows</span>
            <span class="device-tab">Mac</span>
            <span class="device-tab">iPhone</span>
            <span class="device-tab">Android</span>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Windows 10 and 11</h3>
        
        <p>Click the speaker icon in your system tray at the bottom right corner of your screen. You will see a small arrow or dropdown next to the volume slider. Click it to reveal all available audio output devices. Look for your Bluetooth device name in this list and select it. If you do not see your device listed even though it shows as connected in Bluetooth settings, this indicates a driver issue we will address later.</p>
        
        <p>For more detailed control, right-click the speaker icon and select "Sound settings" or "Open Sound settings." Scroll down to the Output section and use the dropdown menu to select your Bluetooth device. Make sure the volume slider is not set to zero and that the device is not muted.</p>
        
        <h3>Mac</h3>
        
        <p>Click the Control Center icon in your menu bar or hold the Option key and click the speaker icon. You will see a list of available output devices. Select your Bluetooth headphones or speaker from this list. If your device appears grayed out or shows as connected but unavailable, you may need to disconnect and reconnect it.</p>
        
        <p>Alternatively, go to System Preferences and then Sound. Click the Output tab to see all available devices and select your Bluetooth device. Check that the output volume is turned up and that the Mute checkbox is not selected.</p>
        
        <h3>iPhone and iPad</h3>
        
        <p>Open Control Center by swiping down from the top right corner of your screen. Long press or firmly press the audio card in the upper right section. This expands to show all available audio outputs including your connected Bluetooth device. Tap your Bluetooth device to route audio to it.</p>
        
        <p>Some apps have their own audio output settings that override system settings. If you are having trouble with a specific app, check within that app's settings for audio or speaker options.</p>
        
        <h3>Android</h3>
        
        <p>Android handles Bluetooth audio routing automatically in most cases, but you can verify the connection by going to Settings, then Connected devices or Bluetooth. Tap on your connected device and look for options related to audio or media. Make sure media audio is enabled for this device.</p>
        
        <p>Some Android phones show a notification when Bluetooth devices connect that allows you to select what type of audio to route to them. Look for this notification in your notification shade and make sure media audio is selected.</p>
        
        <h2>Fix 2: Verify Volume on Both Devices</h2>
        
        <div class="fix-step">
            <h4>The Double Volume Check</h4>
            <p>You need to check volume levels in two places: your source device (phone, computer, tablet) and your Bluetooth device itself. Either one being muted or set to minimum will result in silence.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>Start by turning up the volume on your source device to at least 50 percent. Then check your Bluetooth device. Many headphones and speakers have their own volume controls that operate independently from your phone or computer. If your headphones have physical buttons, try pressing the volume up button several times even if you think the volume is already high.</p>
        
        <p>Some Bluetooth devices have separate volume memories for different connected devices. Your headphones might remember that you had them at full volume on your phone but muted on your laptop. When you switch between devices, the volume level changes accordingly. This can create confusing situations where your headphones work fine with one device but appear broken with another.</p>
        
        <div class="tip-box">
            <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Some apps and media players have their own volume controls that are separate from system volume. Check the volume within the specific app you are trying to use.
        </div>
        
        <h2>Fix 3: Restart the Bluetooth Connection</h2>
        
        <div class="fix-step">
            <h4>The Classic Fix That Often Works</h4>
            <p>Sometimes the Bluetooth connection gets stuck in a bad state. Cycling the connection forces both devices to establish a fresh connection that often resolves audio issues.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>Turn off Bluetooth on your source device completely. Wait for about ten seconds. This gives both devices time to fully disconnect and reset their connection states. Then turn Bluetooth back on and allow your devices to reconnect automatically.</p>
        
        <p>If the automatic reconnection does not happen, you may need to manually select your Bluetooth device from the list of available devices to reconnect. Watch for any error messages during this process as they can provide clues about what is going wrong.</p>
        
        <p>For persistent issues, also try turning your Bluetooth device off and back on. If your headphones or speaker have a power button, hold it until the device fully powers down, wait a few seconds, and then power it back on. This clears any temporary issues in the Bluetooth device itself.</p>
        
        <h2>Fix 4: Unpair and Re-Pair Your Device</h2>
        
        <div class="fix-step">
            <h4>Starting Fresh</h4>
            <p>When simple restarts do not work, removing the pairing entirely and setting up the connection again from scratch often resolves deeper issues.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>Go to your Bluetooth settings and find your problematic device in the list of paired devices. Select the option to forget, unpair, or remove this device. The exact wording varies by operating system, but the result is the same: your device will no longer remember this Bluetooth connection.</p>
        
        <p>Put your Bluetooth device into pairing mode. For most headphones and speakers, this involves holding the power button or a dedicated pairing button for several seconds until you see a flashing light or hear a tone indicating pairing mode. Check your device's manual if you are unsure how to enter pairing mode.</p>
        
        <p>Now go back to your Bluetooth settings and scan for new devices. Select your Bluetooth device when it appears and complete the pairing process. This creates a completely new connection that is not affected by any corruption or misconfiguration from the old pairing.</p>
        
        <h2>Fix 5: Update Your Bluetooth and Audio Drivers</h2>
        
        <div class="fix-step">
            <h4>Windows Users Especially Need This</h4>
            <p>Outdated or corrupted drivers are a leading cause of Bluetooth audio problems, particularly on Windows computers.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>On Windows, right-click the Start button and select Device Manager. Expand the Bluetooth section and right-click on your Bluetooth adapter. Select "Update driver" and then "Search automatically for drivers." Windows will check online for newer drivers and install them if available.</p>
        
        <p>Also check the "Sound, video and game controllers" section in Device Manager. Look for any entries related to Bluetooth audio and update those drivers as well. Sometimes Bluetooth audio issues are actually caused by audio drivers rather than Bluetooth drivers.</p>
        
        <p>If Windows Update does not find new drivers, visit your computer manufacturer's website to download drivers directly. Manufacturers often have newer drivers than what Windows Update provides. Look for your specific computer model and download the latest Bluetooth and audio drivers.</p>
        
        <div class="warning-box">
            <strong>Warning:</strong> Be careful when downloading drivers from the internet. Only use your computer manufacturer's official website or the chipset manufacturer's site to avoid malware.
        </div>
        
        <h2>Fix 6: Check for Bluetooth Audio Service Issues</h2>
        
        <div class="fix-step">
            <h4>Windows Specific</h4>
            <p>Windows runs background services that handle Bluetooth audio. If these services stop or malfunction, your Bluetooth audio will not work even though the basic connection appears fine.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>Press the Windows key and R together to open the Run dialog. Type "services.msc" and press Enter. This opens the Services management window. Look for "Bluetooth Audio Gateway Service" and "Bluetooth Support Service" in the list.</p>
        
        <p>Double-click each service and verify that the Startup type is set to "Automatic" and that the Service status shows "Running." If a service is stopped, click the Start button to start it. If the service fails to start, note any error message as this can help diagnose deeper issues.</p>
        
        <p>You should also check for the "Windows Audio" service and "Windows Audio Endpoint Builder" service. Both of these must be running for any audio to work on your computer, including Bluetooth audio.</p>
        
        <h2>Fix 7: Reset Your Bluetooth Device to Factory Settings</h2>
        
        <div class="fix-step">
            <h4>The Nuclear Option for Your Bluetooth Device</h4>
            <p>If nothing else works, resetting your Bluetooth headphones or speaker to factory settings clears any internal issues that may be preventing audio.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>The reset process varies by manufacturer and model. For most devices, you will need to hold a specific button combination for several seconds. Check your device's manual or search online for your specific model's reset procedure.</p>
        
        <p>After resetting, your Bluetooth device will forget all previous pairings and return to its original state. You will need to pair it with all your devices again as if it were brand new. While this is inconvenient, it often resolves persistent audio issues that other fixes cannot address.</p>
        
        <p>Some devices also have firmware updates that can fix bugs including audio problems. Check the manufacturer's website or app to see if updates are available for your device.</p>
        
        <h2>Fix 8: Check for Audio Profile Compatibility</h2>
        
        <div class="fix-step">
            <h4>A2DP vs HSP/HFP</h4>
            <p>Bluetooth uses different profiles for different types of audio. Understanding these profiles can help you identify why music might not play even though phone calls work, or vice versa.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>A2DP, which stands for Advanced Audio Distribution Profile, is the profile used for high-quality stereo audio like music and video. HSP and HFP, which stand for Headset Profile and Hands-Free Profile, are used for phone calls and voice communication.</p>
        
        <p>If your Bluetooth device is connected using the wrong profile, you might hear phone call audio but not music, or vice versa. In Windows, you can see which profile is active by clicking the speaker icon and checking if your device appears twice with different names, often with "Stereo" and "Hands-Free" designations.</p>
        
        <p>To fix profile issues on Windows, go to Bluetooth settings and look at the device properties. Make sure both "Let audio playback on this device" and "Use this device for calls" are enabled if you want full functionality.</p>

        <h2>Advanced Troubleshooting</h2>
        
        <p>If you have tried all the basic fixes and your Bluetooth audio still is not working, there may be deeper issues at play that require more advanced troubleshooting.</p>
        
        <h3>Check for Interference</h3>
        
        <p>Bluetooth operates on the 2.4 GHz frequency band, which is shared with WiFi networks, wireless mice and keyboards, microwave ovens, and many other devices. Heavy interference can degrade Bluetooth connections to the point where audio stops working even though the connection appears stable.</p>
        
        <p>Try moving closer to your source device. Bluetooth typically works best within about 30 feet with no obstacles, but walls, furniture, and other objects can significantly reduce this range. If your audio works when you are close but fails when you move away, interference or range issues are likely the cause.</p>
        
        <h3>Test with Another Device</h3>
        
        <p>Connect your Bluetooth device to a different phone or computer to determine whether the issue is with your Bluetooth device or your source device. If your headphones work fine with a different phone, the problem is with your original device's settings or configuration. If your headphones fail to produce sound on multiple devices, the issue is with the headphones themselves.</p>
        
        <h3>Check for Hardware Issues</h3>
        
        <p>While rare, Bluetooth devices can develop hardware faults. Look for signs like one ear working but not the other, audio cutting in and out regardless of distance, or the device not charging properly. If you suspect hardware failure, contact the manufacturer about warranty service or replacement.</p>
        
        <h2>When to Seek Professional Help</h2>
        
        <p>If you have worked through all these fixes and still cannot get audio from your Bluetooth device, it may be time to get expert assistance. Complex driver conflicts, hardware failures, and system-level issues sometimes require professional diagnosis and repair.</p>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
            <p class="faq-question">Why is my Bluetooth connected but no sound coming out?</p>
            <p>The most common reason is that your audio output is not set to the Bluetooth device. Even when paired, your computer or phone may still be sending audio to the built-in speakers. Go to your sound settings and make sure your Bluetooth device is selected as the active audio output. Also check that volume is turned up on both your source device and your Bluetooth device.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
            <p class="faq-question">How do I fix Bluetooth audio delay?</p>
            <p>Audio delay, also called latency, is usually caused by the Bluetooth codec being used or interference in your environment. Move closer to your source device and make sure nothing is blocking the signal. If your devices support low-latency codecs like aptX Low Latency, enable them in your Bluetooth settings. Some video players also have audio delay settings you can adjust to sync audio with video.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
            <p class="faq-question">Why does my Bluetooth keep disconnecting?</p>
            <p>Frequent disconnections typically result from low battery, being too far from the source device, interference from other wireless devices, or outdated firmware. Charge your Bluetooth device fully, stay within 30 feet of your source device with a clear line of sight, and check for firmware updates from the manufacturer.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
            <p class="faq-question">Can I connect multiple Bluetooth devices at once?</p>
            <p>Most phones and computers can maintain connections to multiple Bluetooth devices simultaneously, but audio typically plays through only one device at a time. Some premium headphones support multipoint connection, which allows them to stay connected to two devices and automatically switch between them. Check your headphone specifications to see if this feature is supported.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
            <p class="faq-question">My Bluetooth works for calls but not music. Why?</p>
            <p>This happens when your device is connected using the Hands-Free Profile instead of the Advanced Audio Distribution Profile. These are different Bluetooth audio modes, and the wrong one may be active. In your Bluetooth settings, check that media audio or music streaming is enabled for the device, not just calls.</p>
